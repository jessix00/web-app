# web-app
I need to remodel my apartment and checking dozens of websites for used furniture is time consuming. I'm want to build a web application that will scrape specific websites and return results matching my criteria. I'm planning to reasearch more about API's to do this. I want to build it using JavaScript so I can get more familiar with the language. It's the most advanced project I've worked on to date and I'm hoping I'll get to learn a lot while I build this.
